            <td><img src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.MJgL97wJN9aI7bIr_dgnKQHaFj&pid=Api&P=0" alt="HTML source" width="250"></td>
            <td>Hyper link usually take us from one website to another and markup language is to highlight the things in different ways.
                The firstwebsite was created by Tim burners lee who is also the founder of internet.</p>
                <p>For the line break in html we use "BR" tag within angle brackets and it has no closing tag like we have for heading or body tags.
                <br> inside the hr tage we even use many other options called "attributes" dsuch as size of the line,
                allignment and any other things.</p></td>
        </tr>
    </table><hr>

    <h2>Tags</h2>
    <ul><li>br: for the line break</li>
        <li>em: for italic letters</li>
        <li>strong: for bolding the letters</li>
        <li>ul: for bullets</li>
        <li>p: for a paragraph</li>
        <li>hr: for a horizontal line</li>
        <li>h1 h2 h3 h4 h5 h6 : for the heading according to the importance of it</li>
        <li>center left right: for allignment of the text</li>
        <li>title: for the name of the website</li>
        <li>img: for the image to be displayed on the website</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Here ul stands for Unordered List, which means the points here are dots.. and there is a tag also called as "ol" which stands for 
    Ordered List where points are "a,b,c..." or "1,2,3..."</p><hr>

    <h3>Image</h3>
    <p>A image can be inserted to a website through its url code.You can even add the image without depending on any other platform if the image is stored in same directory or the folder as the code </p>
    <img src="https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.b3LA3W7QTeSzo94h0PMOFAHaFj&pid=Api&P=0" alt="flowers" width="150"><br>
    <a href="https://in.images.search.yahoo.com/search/images;_ylt=Awrx.NB_TCBkt.EHYay7HAx.;_ylu=Y29sbwNzZzMEcG9zAzEEdnRpZAMEc2VjA3BpdnM-?p=flowers&fr2=piv-web&type=E211IN714G0&fr=mcafee#id=21&iurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hdwallpaper.nu%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2015%2F10%2Flotus_wallpaper_068.jpg&action=click"><em>MORE FLOWERS</em></a>
    <p>The user can even see how to draw a flower. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcljR2oNWfw">Draw a flower</a> using this link.</p><hr>

    <h3>Hyper Links</h3>
    <p>Hyper links are something that usually takes a user from one website to another. As this link <a href="file:///C:/Users/shrey/OneDrive/Desktop/web%20development/hyperlink.html">THE FIRST LINK</a> takesthe user to an other website.</p>
    <p>This is what the hyper link mean. We just need to copy the url address of that website and paste it in the anchor tag using href attribute. As you can see in the image part there is a link called MORE FLOWERS which takes the user to the website containing the images of flowers</p>
    <p>It's not only about website, it can even take the user to youtube, facebook... just by having a url or link of what we need to see.</p>
    <p>With this we have known the very basic things we need in the upcoming lessons. Stay strong its just the beginning....</p><hr>

    <h3>Table</h3>
    <p>As we know table separates one information from other by getting mixed up. Tables are usually used to maintain a specific indentation after certain data. And in html there is no attribute called columns. It is automatically taken by the compiler as we enter the data.</p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Tags</th>
            <th>description</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>br</td>
            <td>Line break</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>ol</td>
            <td>For bullet points(1,2,3....)(a,b,c...)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>ul</td>
            <td>For bullets points like dots.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>hr</td>
            <td>for horizontal line</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>p</td>
            <td>for a paragraph</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>table</td>
            <td>for creating a table</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>tr</td>
            <td>for creating a row</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>th</td>
            <td>for the row heading</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>img src="" alt=""</td>
            <td>for inserting an image by writing the image address in the source and writing a message in alt if the image is not found</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>a href=""</td>
            <td>its an anchor tag which is used to create a link which leads to an other screen by writing the path of the screen in href</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>em</td>
            <td>for italisizing the font or emphasizing the font</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>strong</td>
            <td>for bolding the font</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>border,color,etc inside the table</td>
            <td>writing border attribute inside the table gives a border to a table (default no borders will be there for a table) and color and many such things.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>center, right, left</td>
            <td>for the allignment.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>h1 to h6</td>
            <td>For the heading outside the table according to the importance of the boldness.</td>
        </tr>
    </table><hr>
    
    <p>Here inside the table tag we are gonna create a table row tag which refers to the row of the table. And the data is entered by using the td tag. when u enter a data using td tag it prints the same in the first column of the first row as u continue to enter the data using td tag in a single tr tag each data refers to the different columns. And the headings for the rows can be given by using th tag.</p><hr>
    <p>We usually don't design the webpage in html. So the bordering or the coloring of the table or the webpage is done with the help of an other language called CSS. So it is not recommanded to use the border or color or any other attributes for the table in html.</p><hr>

    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>things u like</th>
            <th>stars u give</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Food</td>
            <td>⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Play</td>
            <td>⭐⭐⭐</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Sleep</td>
            <td>⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Read</td>
            <td>⭐</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p>How ugly... So this is the reason we use CSS language for styling a webpage.</p>

    <h3>Form in HTML</h3>
    <p>Form is usually a collection of personal details one fill before going to any of the colleges,schools or any website. This might contain your name age and other credentials. Usually java is recommended for the creation of forms like things. In HTML  we can use all the attributes such as a label, button, and many other things to make a form.</p>
    <p>The user can learn creating a form using HTML. <a href="C:\Users\shrey\OneDrive\Desktop\web development\form.html">THE FORM</a></p><hr>

    <p>The "label" tag is used to create a label to make the user know what to enter in the box. And input is the important tag to be used inorder to get the input from the user.and input tag is a self closing tag.</p>
    <p>form has a number of attributes. Some of them are date which gives calender type of to enter the date month and year.</p>
    <p>It has some other attributes such as file.. where we upload the file such as photo or any other document.</p>
    <p>These can be easily done by just changing the "type" of the label. "<label for="">" this kind of statement will be displayed when u enter the label command. We enter the type of the label to be created such as a text,file or date time etc.,</p>
    <p>In the form tag there are also some of the attributes named as "action" , as soon as you hit the submit button it takes you to the address mentioned in the action attribute such as mail using mailto .. and also we use the method as post (idk why) and the entype attribute to specify whether the text should be plain text or any other.</p>
    <p>Inside the form element there are attributes named type, which decided what kind of input the user is going to create, name, for when we hit the submit button to display the text you have entered in the form</p>
